DIY soldering kit based on pixel art pikachu pal!


# PCB design contest 2020

I made this badge to practice how to solder smd parts and get a cool gadget to show.

To made this posible I used free EasyEDA designer tool from EasyEDA.com , it integrastes PCB fabrication with JLCPCB.com and source components from lcsc.com

so you will have :

Electronic capture / PCB LAY out / 3D modeling ( EasyEDA designer)
PCB Fabrication ( JLCpcb.com )
Source components ( lcsc.com )

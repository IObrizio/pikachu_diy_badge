DIY soldering kit based on pixel art pikachu pal!

Here you could fine the complete project to make your own badge.

- Schematic
- PCB
- BOM

It's a simple blinking LED circuit, just a couple of components , basically is an oscillator made of RC circuit.
It run from a 3.0 volts cr2032 battery.

# PCB details: 
- Black solder mask 
- ENIG finish 
- Thickness 1.0mm to 1.6mm ( 1 mm recommended for less weight)


# PCB design contest 2020

I made this badge to practice how to solder smd parts and get a cool gadget to show.

To made this posible I used free EasyEDA designer tool from EasyEDA.com , it integrastes PCB fabrication with JLCPCB.com and source components from lcsc.com

so you will have :

- Electronic capture / PCB LAY out / 3D modeling ( EasyEDA designer)
- PCB Fabrication supplier ( JLCpcb.com )
- Components supplier ( lcsc.com )

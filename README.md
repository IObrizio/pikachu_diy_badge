# PCB design contest 2020

I made this badge to practice how to solder smd parts and get a cool gadget to show.

To made this posible I used free EasyEDA designer tool from EasyEDA.com , it integrastes PCB fabrication with JLCPCB.com and source components from lcsc.com

so you will have :

- Electronic capture / PCB LAY out / 3D modeling ( EasyEDA designer)
- PCB Fabrication supplier ( JLCpcb.com )
- Components supplier ( lcsc.com )
